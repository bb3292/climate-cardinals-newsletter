Climate conference in Copenhagen,en.wikipedia.org,"The 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, commonly known as the Copenhagen Summit, was held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, between 7 and 18 December. The conference included the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 5th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties (CMP 5) to the Kyoto Protocol. According to the Bali Road Map, a framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012 was to be agreed there.On Friday 18 December, the final day of the conference, international media reported that the climate talks were ""in disarray"". Media also reported that in lieu of a summit collapse, only a ""weak political statement"" was anticipated at the conclusion of the conference. The Copenhagen Accord was drafted by the United States, China, India, Brazil and South Africa on 18 December, and judged a ""meaningful agreement"" by the United States government. It was ""taken note of"", but not ""adopted"", in a debate of all the participating countries the next day, and it was not passed unanimously. The document recognised that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the present day and that actions should be taken to keep any temperature increases to below 2 °C. The document is not legally binding and does not contain any legally binding commitments for reducing CO2 emissions.",—,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_conference_in_Copenhagen
